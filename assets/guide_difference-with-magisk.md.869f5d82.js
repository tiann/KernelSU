You can use the environment variable <code>KSU</code> to differentiate it in all places where you can run module scripts (<code>customize.sh</code>, <code>post-fs-data.sh</code>, <code>service.sh</code>). In KernelSU, this environment variable will be set to <code>true</code>.</p><p>Here are some differences:</p><ul><li>KernelSU modules cannot be installed in Recovery mode.</li><li>KernelSU modules do not have built-in support for Zygisk (but you can use Zygisk modules through <a href="https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskOnKernelSU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ZygiskOnKernelSU</a>.</li><li>The method for replacing or deleting files in KernelSU modules is completely different from Magisk. KernelSU does not support the <code>.replace</code> method. Instead, you need to create a same-named file with <code>mknod filename c 0 0</code> to delete the corresponding file.</li><li>The directories for BusyBox are different. The built-in BusyBox in KernelSU is located in <code>/data/adb/ksu/bin/busybox</code>, while in Magisk it is in <code>/data/adb/magisk/busybox</code>. <strong>Note that this is an internal behavior of KernelSU and may change in the future!</strong></li><li>KernelSU does not support <code>.replace</code> files; however, KernelSU supports the <code>REMOVE</code> and <code>REPLACE</code> variable to remove or replace files and folders.</li><li>KernelSU adds <code>boot-completed</code> stage to run some scripts on boot completed.</li><li>KernelSU adds <code>post-mount</code> stage to run some scripts after mounting overlayfs</li></ul>',8),r=[s];function n(l,d,c,h,m,u){return i(),t("div",null,r)}const g=e(a,[["render",n]]);export{p as __pageData,g as default};
