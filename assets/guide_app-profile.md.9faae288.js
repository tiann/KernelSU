It allows customization of the <code>uid</code>, <code>gid</code>, <code>groups</code>, <code>capabilities</code>, and <code>SELinux</code> rules of the <code>su</code> command, thereby restricting the privileges of the root user. For example, it can grant network permissions only to firewall applications while denying file access permissions, or it can grant shell permissions instead of full root access for freeze applications: <strong>keeping the power confined with the principle of least privilege.</strong></p><p>For ordinary applications without root permissions, the App Profile can control the behavior of the kernel and module system towards these applications. For instance, it can determine whether modifications resulting from modules should be addressed. The kernel and module system can make decisions based on this configuration, such as performing operations akin to &quot;hiding&quot;</p><h2 id="root-profile" tabindex="-1">Root Profile <a class="header-anchor" href="#root-profile" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Root Profile&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="uid-gid-and-groups" tabindex="-1">UID, GID, and Groups <a class="header-anchor" href="#uid-gid-and-groups" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;UID, GID, and Groups&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Linux systems have two concepts: users and groups. Each user has a user ID (UID), and a user can belong to multiple groups, each with its own group ID (GID). These IDs are used to identify users in the system and determine which system resources they can access.</p><p>Users with a UID of 0 are known as root users, and groups with a GID of 0 are known as root groups. The root user group typically holds the highest system privileges.</p><p>In the case of the Android system, each app is a separate user (excluding shared UID scenarios) with a unique UID. For example, <code>0</code> represents the root user, <code>1000</code> represents <code>system</code>, <code>2000</code> represents the ADB shell, and UIDs ranging from 10000 to 19999 represent ordinary apps.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Here, the UID mentioned is not the same as the concept of multiple users or work profiles in the Android system. Work profiles are actually implemented by partitioning the UID range. For example, 10000-19999 represents the main user, while 110000-119999 represents a work profile. Each ordinary app among them has its own unique UID.</p></div><p>Each app can have several groups, with the GID representing the primary group, which usually matches the UID. Other groups are known as supplementary groups. Certain permissions are controlled through groups, such as network access permissions or Bluetooth access.</p><p>For example, if we execute the <code>id</code> command in ADB shell, the output might look like this:</p><div class="language-sh"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">sh</span><pre class="shiki material-theme-palenight"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#FFCB6B;">oriole:/</span><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"> $ </span><span style="color:#C3E88D;">id</span></span>

For example, the Root Profile of a root app can set its UID to <code>2000</code>, which means that when using <code>su</code>, the app&#39;s actual permissions are at the ADB shell level. The <code>inet</code> group can be removed, preventing the <code>su</code> command from accessing the network.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Note</p><p>The App Profile only controls the permissions of the root process after using <code>su</code>; it does not control the permissions of the app itself. If an app has requested network access permission, it can still access the network even without using <code>su</code>. Removing the <code>inet</code> group from <code>su</code> only prevents <code>su</code> from accessing the network.</p></div><p>Root Profile is enforced in the kernel and does not rely on the voluntary behavior of root applications, unlike switching users or groups through <code>su</code>, the granting of <code>su</code> permission is entirely up to the user rather than the developer.</p><h3 id="capabilities" tabindex="-1">Capabilities <a class="header-anchor" href="#capabilities" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Capabilities&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Capabilities are a mechanism for privilege separation in Linux.</p><p>For the purpose of performing permission checks, traditional UNIX implementations distinguish two categories of processes: privileged processes (whose effective user ID is 0, referred to as superuser or root), and unprivileged processes (whose effective UID is nonzero). Privileged processes bypass all kernel permission checks, while unprivileged processes are subject to full permission checking based on the process&#39;s credentials (usually: effective UID, effective GID, and supplementary group list).</p><p>Starting with Linux 2.2, Linux divides the privileges traditionally associated with superuser into distinct units, known as capabilities, which can be independently enabled and disabled.</p><p>Each Capability represents one or more privileges. For example, <code>CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH</code> represents the ability to bypass permission checks for file reading, as well as directory reading and execution permissions. If a user with an effective UID of <code>0</code> (root user) lacks <code>CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH</code> or higher capabilities, this means that even though they are root, they cannot read files at will.</p><p>KernelSU&#39;s Root Profile allows customization of the Capabilities of the root process after executing <code>su</code>, thereby achieving partially granting &quot;root permissions.&quot; Unlike the aforementioned UID and GID, certain root apps require a UID of <code>0</code> after using <code>su</code>. In such cases, limiting the Capabilities of this root user with UID <code>0</code> can restrict their allowed operations.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Strong Recommendation</p><p>Linux&#39;s Capability <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">official documentation</a> provides detailed explanations of the abilities represented by each Capability.

It is highly recommended not to use any custom systems running in &quot;permissive mode&quot; since it provides no significant advantages over a completely open system.</p></div><p>Explaining the full concept of SELinux is complex and beyond the scope of this document.

Specific access control rules can be set for this context to enable fine-grained control over root permissions.</p><p>In typical scenarios, when an app executes <code>su</code>, it switches the process to a SELinux domain with <strong>unrestricted access</strong>, such as <code>u:r:su:s0</code>. Through the Root Profile, this domain can be switched to a custom domain, such as <code>u:r:app1:s0</code>, and a series of rules can be defined for this domain:</p><div class="language-sh"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">sh</span><pre class="shiki material-theme-palenight"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#82AAFF;">type</span><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"> </span><span style="color:#C3E88D;">app1</span></span>
