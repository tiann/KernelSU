<p><i>KernelSU</i> is a Kernel based root solution for Android devices. It features kernel-based <code>su</code> and root access management as well as a Module system based on overlayfs (similar to Magisk). <i>KernelSU</i> works whitelist-based: Only App that is granted root permission can access <code>su</code>, other apps cannot perceive <code>su</code>.</p><p><i>KernelSU</i> officially supports Android GKI 2.0 devices(with kernel 5.10+), old kernels(4.14+) is also compatiable, but you need to build kernel yourself. WSA and containter-based Android should also work with <i>KernelSU</i> integrated.</p><p>Current supported ABIs are: <code>arm64-v8a</code> and <code>x86_64</code>.</p>
