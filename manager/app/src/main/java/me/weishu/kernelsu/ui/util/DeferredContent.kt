 * Returns true only after the navigation transition animation has completed
 * and an additional buffer frame has passed.
 *
 * Timeline:
 * - During animation: returns false → page shows lightweight placeholder (smooth animation)
 * - Animation ends + 1 frame: returns true → heavy content composes
 *   (stutter is invisible because the page is already static)
 *
 * The value is sticky — once true it never reverts to false,
 * so content stays visible during exit transitions.
